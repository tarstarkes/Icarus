						<h3>Mary Estes</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/mary.png' %}"/>
						<p>Mary Estes was born and raised in Bend, Oregon. She moved to Union County after graduating from high school. She met her husband Don shortly after arriving in Union County. They have three children, Stephanie, Chris and Michael. Her favorite past time is spending time with her family and friends.<br><br>
						She graduated from La Grande Business College. After college, she worked for the La Grande Ranger District in Business Management. She joined the Grande Ronde Model Watershed Program in 1994. She is the office manager of the program and the secretary of the Grande Ronde Model Watershed Foundation. She loves being part of a team that is working hard to make our rivers and communities a better place to live. She enjoys visiting a completed project site to see the final product. She emphasizes that The flowing of a stream is such a beautiful sound and very relaxing!<br><br>
						Besides working in the office, you will find her gathering volunteers from the community and the various agencies to work on river cleanups, planting projects, fairs, community activities, and school activities during the spring and summer months in both Union and Wallowa Counties. If you would like to volunteer or know of any areas by water bodies that need cleaned, notify Mary. The most satisfying work.....helping others!</p>

						<h3>Jeff Oveson</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/jeff.png' %}"/>
						<p>Jeff Oveson has served as the executive director of the Grande Ronde Model Watershed since January 2000. Prior to coming to the Model Watershed, Jeff spent 19 years operating the family ranch in Wallowa County, where he first became interested in watershed restoration, both through his involvement as a director on the Wallowa Soil and Water Conservation District Board and through the implementation of some restoration projects of his own. Jeff cites the active participation of SWCD board members and others in agriculture as good examples of land and natural resource stewards who provided encouragement for him to pursue restoration projects on the Oveson family property, and to become involved in processes that incubated local decision making about the management of natural resources so critical to the livelihoods of so many eastern Oregonians.<br><br>
						Jeff says the things he likes about his job are the interaction with a “very dynamic, involved and committed board of directors, and the wide variety of people who really care about making the Grande Ronde and Imnaha subbasins a better place.” He also points out that from a relatively small population base, there are a number of widely recognized people who are determined that local decisions are made locally, and that those people are willing to devote immense amounts of time and effort taking their case to Salem, Washington, D.C. and elsewhere in the name of local leadership.<br><br>A graduate of Oregon State University in animal science, Jeff worked six years for Ralston Purina Company in Seattle and Spokane before returning to Wallowa. He and Nancy, his wife, now reside in La Grande.</p>

						<h3>Jesse Steele</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/jesse.png' %}"/>
						<p>It should come as no surprise that the Union County Project Coordinator at GRMW enjoys fishing, loves bird hunting, and owns a couple of hunting dogs named Remington and Max. Nor should it come as a surprise that he doesn’t get out to hunt and fish as much as he’d like because there are things in his life that are much more important: Summer, his wife, Fenley, their son, and Manu, their daughter, are the real center of Jesse’s life. Summer was home schooled in Summerville (no, she wasn’t born there and named after the town) and was a fellow student at EOU when she and Jesse met, and while they were still students, they married and bought the house they live in today. Summer and Jesse are very involved at Calvary Chapel in La Grande, where Summer’s father is Pastor and Jesse serves as a youth leader.<br><br> Jesse comes to GRMW with an excellent background. After graduating from Wallowa High School, he attained a Liberal Studies Major with Minors in Biology and Geology from EOU. Starting soon after graduation, he acquired 6 years of invaluable experience with Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife’s Northeast Fish Research program stationed in Badgley Hall at EOU. His work there was predominantly related to research on spring Chinook and summer steelhead, both populations that are on the federal Endangered Species Act list and native to the Grande Ronde Subbasin.<br><br>Jesse was raised with siblings Jenny and Joel, both of whom now reside out of state. His father Doug taught and coached at Wallowa and now lives in Walla Walla, WA. LeArla, his mother, resides in Washington.<br><br>Although GRMW has partnered with a wide variety of biologists from a multitude of organizations in the past, Jesse is the first full time biologist to serve on the staff and will be assuming a variety of responsibilities, not the least of which is establishing and maintaining relationships with private landowners. Jesse’s work with ODFW allowed him an opportunity to work with a number of private landowners and his position with GRMW will require him to expand the number of landowners he knows and works with across both Union and Wallowa Counties.<br><br>The aforementioned Spring Chinook native to Catherine Creek and the Upper Grande Ronde are two of the highest priority populations to be addressed by the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Biological Opinion (BiOp). The BiOp mandates that the action agencies Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) must mitigate for the operation of the hydropower system on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. GRMW is the local stakeholder group through which much of the funding for restoration projects is allocated, and Jesse will be instrumental in working with partners to identify, design and implement these projects, with special emphasis on Catherine Creek and the Upper Grande Ronde River. His appreciation of private landowners and their priorities, along with his own passion for habitat restoration work make him a natural to fill this role for GRMW.<br><br>When Jesse applied for the position at GRMW, he stated that it was his desire to be more directly involved in habitat restoration work, and that he wanted the opportunity to continue to work with private landowners. When asked about his work with local farmers and ranchers, Jesse offered that he was pleased that so many of them were not only willing to allow him on their property, but that they were curious about what he was learning about fish on their property and how fish populations were doing. Jesse believes that fish and farming are compatible and he’ll have his chance to prove it.

						<h3>Coby Menton</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/coby.png' %}"/>
						<p>Though his job title is "Project Coordinator”, Coby Menton does much more than that for the Grande Ronde Model Watershed Program (GRMWP). Presently the only GRMWP staff member who lives and offices in Wallowa County, Coby is called upon to serve as the emissary to a number of Wallowa County partners, helping coordinate projects, participating in local committees and advisory groups, gauging stream flows, and generally “covering the bases” for GRMWP in Wallowa County.<br><br>
						Coby usually spends a day per week in Union County with other partners and staff members, coordinating monitoring and stream gauging, with some weeks requiring the 140 miles round trip commute 2 or more times.<br><br>
						Born in Minnesota in 1970, Coby moved shortly thereafter to Northern California, then moved again to Joseph in 1983, where he continues to reside today along with his wife Deve and their son Bayden. The years in between the relocation to Joseph and now were filled with education and adventure. Coby matriculated at the University of Oregon, receiving a BS in Geology in 1993, then followed his college career with a variety of stints at a bicycle shop, building trails, working in a bakery, landscaping, and carpentry.<br><br>
						In May of 1996, Coby started work for the Wallowa Soil and Water Conservation District (WSWCD), measuring stream flow and monitoring water quality, coordinating and working with a number of partners such as Oregon Department of Water Resources and US Geological Survey, as well as a large number of private landowners. In 2002, GRMWP made the decision to add a position on staff, and Coby’s work with the WSWCD made him extremely well qualified to become the Monitoring Coordinator at GRMWP, taking the responsibility for developing and implementing a program across the Grande Ronde and Imnaha sub basins, developing and storing data available to anyone, and always there to help develop more new restoration projects.

						<h3>Connar Stone</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/connar.png' %}"/>
						<p>For most people, the field of computer science is essentially a foreign language. Ironically, programmers and IT gurus have to know several types of languages to make computers, well--compute, that for the untrained onlooker, is practically magic. The concept of being both multi-lingual and a bit of a magician isn’t one that’s lost on Connar Stone, the new IT and Database Manager for the Grande Ronde Model Watershed (GRMW). Before entering the Computer Science program at Eastern Oregon University (EOU), Connar considered a degree in linguistics, having a keen interest in both Spanish and Japanese. In an introductory course at EOU, Connar made the connection between this linguistic adeptness and his natural aptitude for electronics. Connar is also a bit of a wizard when it comes to card tricks; so much so, that to see him perform one of these illusions, you can’t help but believe that he can make miracles happen when put to the test on a stubborn PC.<br><br>
						Connar was born in Spokane, Washington and lived on Fairchild Air Force Base for a number of years before moving to the southern Oregon coast. In 2000, his dad’s job with the Oregon State Police relocated his family to Cove, Oregon where he graduated from high school in 2008. After graduating, Connar spent four years as an active duty member of the Air Force, which took him to Texas, Delaware and finally to California where he spent most of his military career working in heavy aircraft operations. Early in his enlistment, Connar married his wife Hannah Stone (formerly Ricker, who is from Union), the two now have a one-year-old daughter named Kiona. He says that his fondest memories of the Air Force are the relationships he built with his comrades and their families. He can distinctly remember an early morning, after having worked the entire night, watching a C-5 jet taking off into the colorful California sunrise, being a particularly inspirational moment during his service.<br><br>
						In June of this year, Connar graduated from EOU and was named the 2016 Outstanding Student in Computer Science. When he isn’t busy with his wife, daughter, or their two dogs and three cats, you may find him outside flying his drone.  A hobby he picked up after being tasked to become the ‘drone expert’ here at GRMW.  In just two months on the job, Connar has mastered GRMWs two drones, capturing aerial imagery of project sites and water temperature data with a FLIR (thermal) camera.  As if he wasn’t useful enough, this aerial imagery and data capture will be an invaluable contribution to our project partners as they implement and monitor large scale restoration projects.  
						Connar’s ability to find inventive solutions for tech problems and his prowess as a magician make him a pretty popular guy around the office, but it’s his willingness to explain anything from quantum computers to the nuances of Google Docs that sets him apart from ‘your company’s computer guy’.  Although, he says ‘I’m no David Blane’, we think he’s pretty impressive and hope that Connar will keep GRMW on the cutting edge of technology for many years to come.

						<h3>Jessica Phelps</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/jessica.png' %}"/>
						<p>Oregon native Jessica Phelps has spent her fair share of time in the great outdoors; in fact, for two years she lived off the grid in the Opal Creek Wilderness. Opal Creek Ancient Forest Center is an environmental education facility located in the Opal Creek Wilderness part of the Willamette National Forest.  The Facility was an old mining camp that was established in the early 1900s, many of the buildings being over one-hundred years in age. Opal Creek, located three miles behind a locked gate, is without cell phone service and depends on propane, hydro, and solar power to operate. This remote living environment, away from conventional infrastructure and medical resources gave Jessica a deep connection to the area, while strengthening her leadership skills. Jessica would say that Opal Creek is one of the places in Oregon she’s most familiar with, and her favorite (to date).<br><br>
						Jessica’s educational, professional and personal connections have taken her throughout the Willamette Valley, central Oregon and the Columbia Gorge. As a graduate student, Jessica spent time in the north fork John Day River monitoring restoration projects and gained a profound appreciation for eastern Oregon. As the new Restoration Outreach Coordinator for the Grande Ronde Model Watershed and Freshwater Trust, Jessica is most excited about working with landowners and the community and using those connections to build familiarity with the landscape.<br><br>
						Born and raised in Eugene, it’s perhaps no surprise that Jessica attended the University of Oregon for both undergrad and graduate school, earning degrees in Environmental Geography. Still, Jessica says that her Duck fandom “runs in the family.” Her father has taught at the University for over thirty years, and she’s been cheering in Autzen stadium from the same seats her entire life. Jessica remembers road tripping in the family van to the 1995 Rose Bowl, “they lost to Penn State, but it was still fun.” She and her family also regularly attend track meets at the historic Hayward field.<br><br>
						For the last year, Jessica has been getting her hands dirty on a working farm in Sublimity, Oregon, expanding her knowledge of production agriculture. When she’s not on the clock, you may find Jessica on the water. Jessica sheepishly admits to owning four canoes with her boyfriend. The pair are just finishing construction on a whitewater dory that they hope to put to use later this year on the Snake and Salmon rivers. She and her boyfriend have two dogs which keep them quite busy, and provide company for Jessica on her regular trail runs. Jessica’s says her favorite new hobby is fly fishing, a pastime that will serve her well at her new post in La Grande.<br><br>
						As the Restoration Outreach Coordinator, Jessica’s role will be to connect with landowners and the general public throughout the Grande Ronde Basin, spreading awareness about the personal benefits of flow restoration, water leasing, and habitat restoration. Jessica will also be integral in the upcoming Irrigation Efficiency Feasibility Study on Catherine Creek. Jessica’s approachable personality and experience connecting with people in a variety of natural resource settings make her a great fit to shoulder this responsibility, and we wish her the best of luck in the coming year.

						<h3>Alex Borgerding</h3>
						<img align="left" class="portrait" src="{% static 'images/staff/alex.png' %}"/>
						<p>Alex Borgerding, the new GIS Technician at the Grande Ronde Model Watershed (GRMW), grew up riding horses and shooting cans in a beautiful, remote canyon that boasts a population of 175 people and a whole lot of rattlesnakes.  To this day Alex says that Imnaha was her favorite place to live and that she returns often, although mostly in the late fall and winter when she can hike and ride horses without worrying about snakes.  Growing up in Imnaha and later, Joseph, Alex was deeply influenced by her time spent outdoors.  As a child she remembers nights where she got to go with her dad to check on the cows (she liked to man the spotlight), hiking in the Eagle Caps with her mom and spending countless summer days swimming in Wallowa Lake. <br><br>
						Despite her appreciation for the rural landscape she grew up in, Alex, like many kids in Eastern Oregon, couldn’t wait to get out.  She traveled as an exchange student to Hungary for her sophomore year, and then after high school, headed off to the west side of the Cascades, eventually landing in Portland.  While in Portland, Alex attended Portland State University (PSU), worked for the GAP, got her cosmetology license and volunteered at the Sauvie Island Center teaching kids about organic gardening.  After years spent in Portland, Alex couldn’t wait to come home, and we’re so glad she did!<br><br>
						Alex got her degree in Geography from Portland State and says she was immediately intrigued by her GIS courses.  This interest motivated her to further her GIS education with a graduate certificate from OSU eCampus.  Alex cites the family atlas as her favorite ‘book’ as a child and says “I really like the power maps have to display data in such a user friendly way and that geographic reasoning applies to every subject.”  Alex’s love of maps will serve her well in her new position with the GRMW where she will be providing map making and data analysis services for the GRMW and to all of our partners.  Alex says she is excited to work for GRMW because “I believe in the work that is being accomplished here and what better place to that than a place I love so much”.  As a Wallowa County native, Alex will bring insight and a unique perspective to what will be some of her main projects in the coming years, the Wallowa County Atlas Project and Ripples.<br><br>
						When she’s not working you will find Alex outside hunting, fishing, hiking, swimming or playing with her four-month old puppy named Bailey who everyone at GRMW hopes will become the new office dog.  Alex might be the prototypical millennial, focused on a healthy lifestyle and a sustainable environment.Instead of sitting at her desk, she stands, lights off to avoid the glare from fluorescent, hydro flask at the ready. She holds tightly to her roots while looking with open eyes and curious mind to the world beyond her.
