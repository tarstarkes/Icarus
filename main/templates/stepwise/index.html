			<div class="content">
				<p>The Stepwise Process gives a clear and transparent way for partners in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha Subbasins of the Snake River to apply for restoration funds. The process starts with a Prospectus which is submitted in order to give GRMW a brief overview of the project. Once GRMW reviews the prospectus they will then invite the project sponsor to submit a Draft Proposal. The Draft Proposal is used by the Implementation Team to evaluate the project. Draft Proposals are accepted twice a year; once on March 1st and again on September 15th. A site visit is conducted and the sponsor then submits a Final Proposal that reflects the changes requested by the Implementation Team. The Final Proposal is then given to GRMW's <a href="/board/">Board of Directors</a> for a funding decision. The GRMW has an ongoing open solicitation process for all project prospectuses. <a href="/staff/">GRMW staff</a> is available throughout the year to provide technical assistance or guidance in the development of projects and funding applications. Below is a link to the Stepwise Process.</p>
